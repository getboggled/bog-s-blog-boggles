i used to think optimists were resigned, stupid, or didn't bother educating themselves on the world, and now i realise that some people can be not emotionally distraught about Everything while still caring a lot<br>

some things i have recently enjoyed:<br>
1. friends til death: failboat and dougdoug answer questions from viewers while playing games, but if they die in the game, the episode end immediately. the rest of the episode is just "thanks for watching" for ages until it reaches the 20 minute mark for the video.<br>
2. my new big jeans. so big. so roomy. so cool.<br>
3. driving for a very long time<br>
4. dressing up as a dinosaur. RAAAAAAAAAAAR<br>
5. twitch.tv/unclezeming: just some guy who goes around the streets of london cooking with a portable stovetop. will just talk to anyone and give them food too sometimes. lovely idea and very honest reviews of his own cooking. pure soul<br>

right now i am listening to catchyalater by frog instead of sleeping. i don’t know what i’m doing here. i deleted all my social media because it put so many worms in my brain. why am i back here? i think maybe i like the idea of having somewhere where no one knows me. no one has to listen. i actually think it’s kind of important that i get used to the idea that no one is listening. sometimes it’s hard to think things and just smile back at myself in my brain. people don’t expect this from me because i’m quiet. i don’t even expect it from me. hm. much 2 think about<br>
